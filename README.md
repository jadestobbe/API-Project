#Riot Updated their API back in May, I have not had time to redo everything yet.
# Riot API Project
A three page web app which leverages the Riot API to search up information about players.
This project uses node.js, Javascript, HTML, CSS, and Web Components.
The page routing is done using page.js
## Build

```js
npm install
npm install page
npm install --global gulp-cli
gulp
npm start
```
## Use the search bar to search up a summoners profile
for example my user name in League of Legends is jadestobbe,
other users include floofy, self divination, and elusive eko

## After searching for a Summoner and finding their profile you can see if they have won or lost their last 10 games
